# Martín Figares - Tech CV

## Profile

Since joining the industry in 2021, I've worked with amazing people who helped me grow, and I've had the opportunity to help them grow in return. I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at TrashLab, but in previous roles I've also been an interviewer, mentor, platform lead, project manager, and the technical counterpart for diverse stakeholders.

What I'd most like to be known for is being a team multiplier. I focus on understanding the team I work in and the value it can deliver, then work to optimize for it by being empathetic and acting as a team player. I put strong emphasis on communication.
