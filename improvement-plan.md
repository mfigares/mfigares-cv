# CV App Improvement Plan

## Formatting / Visual

### High Priority
- [x] Use `|` separators in personal info line instead of commas (better visual separation)
- [x] Add more spacing between profile paragraphs in Tech CV
- [x] Make date formatting consistent across all CVs - using "Mon Year" format everywhere

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add a favicon
- [ ] Consider subtle background color for skill items (tags style) - optional, might be too fancy

## Content

### Biology CV
- [x] Add a brief profile/summary at the top (similar to Tech CV) to contextualize research background quickly

### Tech CV
- [x] Core Strengths expanded with brief examples/context

### General Skills
- [x] Converted to shared sections (Core Strengths, Languages, Certifications, Activities) that auto-append to all CVs
- [x] Removed as standalone CV option

## Features

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Option to combine CVs for export (e.g., Tech + Languages in one PDF)
- [ ] Light theme option for print (some recruiters prefer white background)
- [ ] Add LinkedIn / GitHub links to personal info header

---

## Technical

- [ ] Add meta tags for SEO (title, description, og:image)
- [ ] Consider adding a "last updated" date somewhere
