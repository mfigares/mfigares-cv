# CV App Improvement Plan

## Formatting / Visual

### High Priority
- [x] Use `|` separators in personal info line instead of commas (better visual separation)
- [x] Add more spacing between profile paragraphs in Tech CV
- [ ] Make date formatting consistent across all CVs (e.g., "Jul 2025" vs "2015 - 2019") - needs feedback on preferred format

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add a favicon
- [ ] Consider subtle background color for skill items (tags style) - optional, might be too fancy

## Content

### Biology CV
- [ ] Add a brief profile/summary at the top (similar to Tech CV) to contextualize research background quickly

### Tech CV
- [ ] Core Strengths could include brief examples:
  - "Technical leadership & mentoring" → "Technical leadership & mentoring (led team of 4)"
  - Or keep as-is if you prefer concise

### General Skills
- [ ] Consider adding soft skills section (adaptability, teamwork, etc.)
- [ ] Consider adding cross-domain tools (Git, productivity tools)
- [ ] Or: deprecate this CV entirely and keep content distributed in Tech/Biology CVs

## Features

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Option to combine CVs for export (e.g., Tech + Languages in one PDF)
- [ ] Light theme option for print (some recruiters prefer white background)
- [ ] Add LinkedIn / GitHub links to personal info header

---

## Technical

- [ ] Add meta tags for SEO (title, description, og:image)
- [ ] Consider adding a "last updated" date somewhere
