# mfigares-cv

This repository contains a version of my CV.

If the CV appears outdated or you need a more recent version, please contact me so I can update it.

## Running the project

To view and export CVs as PDF:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser. Use the dropdown to select a CV variant (Tech, Biology & Research, or General Skills), then click "Export to PDF" to save it.
